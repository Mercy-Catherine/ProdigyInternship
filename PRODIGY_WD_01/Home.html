        <h4>Introduction about Roses:</h4>
        <section>
        <p class="hp1">The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose. Roses are native primarily to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers being native to North America and a few to Europe and northwest Africa. Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to determine basic species. Fewer than 10 species, mostly native to Asia, were involved in the crossbreeding that ultimately produced todayâ€™s many types of garden roses.</p>
